1. simulate.py:
   This script generates toy Higgs-like invariant mass datasets for different integrated luminosities. To use it, run the script, enter a comma-separated list of luminosities (e.g. 0.1,1,5), and optionally adjust the signal mass, width, amplitude, and random seed; the code will output one CSV file per luminosity containing expected and observed background, signal, and total counts in each mass bin. Simulated datasets used in our analysis has already been generated with the default values, only changing the luminosity.
